## Installation

Phpwol is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/tomnomnom/phpwol) so you can 
install it using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Just specify it as a dependency in your 
`composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "tomnomnom/phpwol": "0.1.0"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install`:

```
▶ composer install
Loading composer repositories with package information
Installing dependencies
  - Installing tomnomnom/phpwol (0.1.0)
    Downloading: 100%         

Writing lock file
Generating autoload files
```

Once installed you can use the Composer autoloader instead of the one provided in `./Phpwol/Init.php`:

```php
<?php
require __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';

$f = new \Phpwol\Factory();
$m = $f->magicPacket();
```

## Usage

A `\Phpwol\MagicPacket` object is used to send a WOL packet. Such an object is availble via the `\Phpwol\Factory::magicPacket()` method.


```php
<?php
// ./Examples/Basic.php
require __DIR__.'/../Phpwol/Init.php';

$f = new \Phpwol\Factory();
$magicPacket = $f->magicPacket();

$macAddress = '50:46:5C:53:94:25';
$broadcastIP = '192.168.1.255';

$result = $magicPacket->send($macAddress, $broadcastIP);

if ($result){
  echo "Worked\n";
} else {
  echo "Failed\n";
}

```

```
▶ php ./Examples/Basic.php
Worked
```

If you don't know what the broadcast IP is and don't know how to work it out, you can just specify the IP and subnet mask 
and everything will be worked out for you.

```php
<?php
// ./Examples/UnknownBroadcast.php
require __DIR__.'/../Phpwol/Init.php';

$f = new \Phpwol\Factory();
$magicPacket = $f->magicPacket();

$macAddress = '50:46:5C:53:94:25';
$ip = '192.168.1.10';
$subnet = '255.255.255.0';

$result = $magicPacket->send($macAddress, $ip, $subnet);

if ($result){
  echo "Worked\n";
} else {
  echo "Failed\n";
}

```

```
▶ php ./Examples/UnknownBroadcast.php
Worked
```

## Requirements

* Linux of some description
* PHP 5.3 or newer
